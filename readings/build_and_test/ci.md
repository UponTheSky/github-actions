## About continuous integration
- **CI**: a SW practice that requires frequently commiting code to a shared repository
- why "frequently"? 
  - detecting errors earlier and easier => reduces efforts on debugging
  - for easier cooperation: less merge conflicts
- what could be checked?: linting, formatting, security checks, code coverage, functional tests, etc.
- using CI server: the server checks for new code commits in a repository

## About continuous integration using GitHub Actions
- github actions: workflows build the code in your repo, and run your tests
